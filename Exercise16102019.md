# In this exercise you will try hands on with the comparators and Comparable implementations
* Clone this repository and import it as a gradle project in eclipse or any other IDE of your choice
* Have a look at the file [Song.java](src/main/java/comparator/Song.java) see that it implements a Comparable interface
* You can also see that it implements a compareTo method
```java
   public int compareTo(Song s)
    {
        return title.compareTo(s.getTitle());
    }
```
* Your task is to change this compareTo implementation to compare using the rating attribute
   - Remeber your compareTo method should return 0 if ratings are equal, a positve number if this.rating is greather than other song's rating and a negative number otherwise
* Run the sorting algorithm again to see the change in order (run [Jukebox.java](src/main/java/comparator/Jukebox.java))
* After this implement a RatingComparator which sorts according to the rating, if the ratings of two songs are equal then break the tie with the artist name
   - have a look at the ArtistCompare comparator whcih sorts according to the artist name
```java
	class ArtistCompare implements Comparator<Song> {
		public int compare(Song one, Song two) {
			return one.getArtist().compareTo(two.getArtist());
		}
	}
```
* Finally, use the TreeSet datastructure to keep the songs sorted by rating and write a method to retrieve the top-k rated songs
```java
public Song[] getTopKSongs(int k){
   //TODO return top-k songs according to their rating
   return null;
}
```
