# In this exercise you will try hands on with the comparators and Comparable implementations
* Clone this repository and import it as a gradle project in eclipse or any other IDE of your choice
* Have a look at the file [Song.java](src/main/java/comparator/Song.java) see that it implements a Comparable interface
* You can also see that it implements a compareTo method
```java
   public int compareTo(Song s)
    {
        return title.compareTo(s.getTitle());
    }
```
