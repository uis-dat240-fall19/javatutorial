# In this exercise you will make the BoundedQueue from your assignment1 thread safe.

* First create 2 threads 
* In the run method of thread 1 insert items into the bounded queue
* In the run method of thread 2 remove items from the bounded queue
* Make the BoundedQueue so that the BoundedQueue behaves as expected
* You can either use your own implementation of the BoundedQueue or use the one here [ThreadSafeBoundedQueue](src/main/java/threads/ThreadSafeBoundedQueue.java)
